Finite State Machine for Snakes and Ladders game

Kind character codes:
    S = Snake, L = Ladder (aka Chute), B = Blank

How to use:
1. Make a game object with the number of board squares
2. Create the links between state objects to define snakes or ladders
3. Call game.make_state_kinds() to finish initializations
4. Call game.run()
5. Access game.records object to see results
